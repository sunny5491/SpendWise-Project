# Project Idea: SpendWise (Personal Finance Tracker)

### What I am building:
A Full Stack application that allows users to log their daily expenses, categorize them, and set a monthly budget to track their financial health.

### Key Features:
1. **User Authentication:** Secure Sign-up and Login.
2. **Expense Management:** Add, Update, and Delete expenses (Title, Amount, Category, Date).
3. **Monthly Budgeting:** Set a limit for the month and see how much is remaining.
4. **Filtering:** View expenses by category (e.g., Food, Transport, Rent).
5. **Insights:** A simple calculation of total spending vs. the set budget.
